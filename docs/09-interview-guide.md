## Interview Structure

### Section 1: Warm-up and Context (5 minutes)

**Goal**: Build rapport, understand participant background, set comfortable tone.

**Questions**:

1. "Thanks for joining today. Before we dive in, can you tell me a bit about what you do?"
   - Listen for: Role, industry, work context

2. "How would you describe your relationship with note-taking? Is it something you do constantly, occasionally, or only when you have to?"

### Section 2: "Last Time" Narrative (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand real workflow through concrete recent example, identify pain points in context.

**Primary Question**:

"I'd like you to think back to the last time you took notes for [work/research/a project]. Can you walk me through that experience from start to finish? What were you doing, what tools did you use, what happened?"

**Critical**: Let participant tell story without interruption initially. Take notes on:
- Trigger event (what prompted note-taking)
- Tools used and switching between them
- Information sources and formats
- Organization decisions made
- Retrieval or use of notes afterward
- Any frustrations or friction points mentioned

**Follow-up Probes**:

1. "You mentioned using [tool]. What happened next?"

2. "How did you decide where to put that information?"

3. "When you needed to find that again later, how did that go?"

4. "Was there anything frustrating about that experience?"

5. "If you could have waved a magic wand to make that easier, what would you have changed?"

6. "How long did that whole process take, roughly?"

7. "Did you end up using those notes afterward? How did that go?"

**Listen for**:
- Context-switching between apps
- Search and retrieval challenges
- Manual linking or organization effort

1. "Can you give me a complete picture of all the tools you currently use for notes, research, and managing information?"
   - Listen for: Complete list, not just primary tool

2. "How do these different tools connect together in your workflow? Do they talk to each other, or are they separate?"
   - Listen for: Integration level, manual bridging

3. "Which tool has your most important or valuable notes in it?"
   - Listen for: Data location, perceived value

4. "Have you tried other note-taking tools in the past year or two that you ended up not sticking with?"
   - Listen for: Failed adoptions, why they failed

**Probes**:
- "Why did you choose [tool] originally?"

### Section 4: Pain Points Exploration (8 minutes)

**Goal**: Quantify pain severity, understand specific problems, validate hypotheses.

**Questions**:

1. "What's the most frustrating thing about how you currently take and manage notes?"
   - Listen for: Top-of-mind pain, emotion

2. "Can you tell me about a time in the last month when your note-taking system failed you or let you down?"
   - Listen for: Specific failure story, consequences

3. "On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is extremely painful and 1 is no problem at all, how would you rate your overall frustration with your current note-taking situation?"
   - Record: Pain severity score
   - Follow up: "What would make that a 10? What would make it a 1?"

4. "How much time would you estimate you lose per day dealing with note-taking frictionâ€”searching for things, switching between tools, reorganizing, that kind of thing?"
   - Listen for: Time loss estimate (validate H1)

5. "Have you ever lost notes or information that you needed? What happened?"
   - Listen for: Data loss fears, actual losses

6. "Do you ever feel like valuable insights or connections are buried in your notes somewhere, but you can't find them?"
   - Listen for: Insight discovery problems (validate H4)

**Probes**:
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do about it?"
- "How often does that happen?"
- "What's the impact when that happens?"

**Listen for**:
- Privacy concerns (validate H2)

4. "How important is it to you that your notes are stored locally on your computer versus in the cloud? Why?"
   - Listen for: Privacy attitudes (validate H2)

5. "How important is it that you can access and use your notes without an internet connection?"
   - Listen for: Offline importance (validate H5)

6. "If a tool could automatically suggest connections between your notes or surface related information, would that be valuable to you or feel intrusive?"
   - Listen for: Automation attitudes (validate H7)

**Probes**:
- "Why is that important to you?"

### Section 7: Closing and Beta Opt-In (1 minute)

**Goal**: Thank participant, collect beta interest, send incentive.

**Script**:

"That's all my questions. This has been really helpful. A few final things:

1. We're planning to develop a Windows desktop app for note-taking that addresses some of the problems we've talked about today. Would you be interested in testing an early version when it's ready?"
   - Record: Beta interest (yes/no/maybe)

2. Is there anything else about your note-taking experience that you think would be helpful for me to know?"
   - Listen for: Anything missed

## Post-Interview Checklist

- [ ] Stop and save recording
- [ ] Send gift card code within 24 hours
- [ ] Export and anonymize transcript
- [ ] Document participant ID, archetype, and key themes in research log
- [ ] Note any follow-up questions or clarifications needed
- [ ] Update recruitment tracker with completion

## Interview Best Practices

### Do:
- Use open-ended questions that invite stories
- Follow participant's lead into interesting areas
- Ask "Can you give me an example?" frequently
- Probe on emotions and specific incidents
- Be comfortable with silence (let participant think)
- Take notes even when recording
- Show genuine curiosity

### Don't:
- Lead participant toward desired answers
- Pitch the product concept (this is discovery, not validation)
- Interrupt or rush participant through stories
- Skip pain severity quantification
- Forget to ask about willingness to pay
- Assume you understand without probing deeper

### Probing Techniques:
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "Can you walk me through exactly what happened?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do next?"
- "Why do you think that happened?"
- "What would have been better?"

---

## Hypothesis Mapping

Each section maps to specific hypotheses:

- **Section 2 & 3**: H1 (context-switching), H3 (manual linking), H4 (insight discovery)
- **Section 4**: All hypotheses, especially pain quantification
- **Section 5**: H2 (privacy), H5 (offline), H7 (automation), H9 (import), H10 (graph)
- **Section 6**: H6 (willingness to pay)

Ensure all hypothesis areas covered during interview through natural conversation flow.

---

## Adaptation Notes

Adjust emphasis based on participant archetype:

**Rachel (analyst)**: Emphasize cross-project synthesis, search quality, privacy/security
**Finn (freelancer)**: Emphasize simplicity, offline capability, affordability
**Gia (student)**: Emphasize relationship mapping, citations, data safety

Use screener responses to customize questions and show familiarity with their context.

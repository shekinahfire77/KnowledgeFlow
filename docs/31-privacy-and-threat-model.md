# Privacy Architecture & Threat Model

Version: 0.1
Owner: product-lead
Status: Draft
Last updated: 2025-10-31

## Privacy Principles

**Core Promise**: Your data never leaves your device. No accounts, no clouds, no tracking.

**Design Philosophy**:
1. **Offline-First**: App works perfectly with zero network connectivity
2. **Local-Only Storage**: All data in SQLite on user's machine
3. **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive note content
4. **Minimal Metadata**: Only store what's necessary for functionality
5. **User Control**: All features can be disabled, data can be exported/deleted

---

## Data Architecture

### What Data We Store

**Local SQLite Database** (`C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\knowledgeflow\knowledgeflow.db`):

| Table | Data | Encrypted? | Purpose |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| `notes` | title, body, tags, timestamps | body: YES (optional) | Note content |
| `tasks` | title, note_id, status, timestamps | title: YES (optional) | Extracted actions |
| `links` | src_id, dst_id, weight, kind | NO | Semantic graph edges |
| `embeddings` | note_id, vector_json, algo | NO | TF-IDF vectors (cache) |
| `settings` | key-value pairs (JSON) | NO | User preferences |

**What's Encrypted** (if user enables):
- Note bodies (`notes.enc_blob` column)
- Task descriptions
- Any user-entered text

**What's NOT Encrypted** (for functionality):
- Metadata: created_at, updated_at, note IDs
- Tags (needed for filtering/search)
- Full-text search index (FTS5 virtual table)
- Links and embeddings (numerical data)
- Settings

**Rationale**: Full-text search requires plaintext index. Trade-off: Performance vs. maximum security. User can clear FTS index and rely only on encrypted full-body search (slower).

### Encryption Implementation

**Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **Nonce/IV**: 96 bits (12 bytes), randomly generated per encryption
- **Authentication Tag**: 128 bits (16 bytes), prevents tampering
- **Library**: libsodium (sodium-native npm package)

**Encryption Flow**:
```
Plaintext ‚Üí AES-256-GCM(key, nonce) ‚Üí Ciphertext || Tag
Store: nonce || ciphertext || tag as BLOB in database
```

**Decryption Flow**:
```
Read BLOB ‚Üí Extract nonce, ciphertext, tag
AES-256-GCM-Decrypt(key, nonce, ciphertext, tag) ‚Üí Plaintext (or error if tampered)
```

### Key Management

**Windows (Primary)**: DPAPI (Data Protection API)
- Keys stored in Windows Credential Manager
- Protected by user's Windows login credentials
- Automatic encryption/decryption via OS
- API: `node-dpapi` npm package

**Fallback (Cross-Platform)**: Passphrase-Based
- User enters passphrase on first launch (if DPAPI unavailable)
- Derive key using PBKDF2:
  - **Algorithm**: PBKDF2-SHA256
  - **Iterations**: 100,000 (OWASP recommendation)
  - **Salt**: 128-bit random salt (stored in settings)
  - **Output**: 256-bit key
- Passphrase never stored, only derived key hash for verification

**Key Storage Location**:
- DPAPI: Windows Credential Manager (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Credentials`)
- Passphrase mode: Derived key stored in `settings` table (hashed, not plaintext passphrase)

**Key Recovery**:
- **DPAPI**: Automatic (tied to Windows account)
- **Passphrase**: **No recovery if forgotten** - data is permanently unrecoverable (warn user prominently)

## Threat Model

### Threats In Scope

#### 1. Physical Disk Access (Laptop Theft, Disk Imaging)

**Threat**: Attacker gains physical access to user's hard drive (laptop stolen, disk removed)

**Likelihood**: Medium (common for mobile workers, travel scenarios)

**Impact**: High (all notes exposed if unencrypted)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Encryption at rest with AES-256-GCM
- ‚úÖ DPAPI ties key to user account (can't decrypt on different machine without user credentials)
- ‚úÖ Passphrase mode requires strong passphrase (recommend 16+ characters)

**Residual Risk**: If attacker also compromises Windows account password, DPAPI keys are accessible. Mitigation: Use passphrase mode with strong passphrase separate from Windows password.

---

#### 2. Backup Exposure (Cloud Backup Services)

**Threat**: User has OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive syncing `AppData` folder, exposing encrypted database to cloud

**Likelihood**: High (many users have cloud backup enabled by default)

**Impact**: Medium (data is encrypted, but still increases attack surface)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ First-launch warning: "Disable cloud backup for KnowledgeFlow data folder?"
- ‚úÖ Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Checkbox: "I've disabled cloud backup for app folder"
- ‚úÖ Documentation: Instructions to exclude `AppData\Roaming\knowledgeflow` from OneDrive, Dropbox
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User responsibility: We can't programmatically disable cloud sync (no API access)

**Residual Risk**: If user ignores warning, encrypted database syncs to cloud. Data is still encrypted, but key may be vulnerable if DPAPI and cloud account both compromised.

---

#### 3. Malware / Keylogger

**Threat**: Malware on user's machine logs keystrokes (captures passphrase) or dumps memory (extracts decryption key)

**Likelihood**: Medium (common threat for consumer devices)

**Impact**: High (complete compromise - attacker can read all notes)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚ùå **No effective mitigation at application level** (OS-level threat)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User responsibility: Antivirus, OS security updates, avoid suspicious downloads
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Transparency: Document in FAQ that KnowledgeFlow cannot protect against OS-level malware

**Residual Risk**: High. This is an inherent limitation of local-only apps. If OS is compromised, all bets are off.

---

#### 4. Memory Dump (Process Memory Inspection)

**Threat**: Attacker with admin privileges dumps KnowledgeFlow process memory, extracting decrypted note content or keys

**Likelihood**: Low (requires admin access and targeted attack)

**Impact**: Medium (one-time exposure of currently open notes)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Clear sensitive data from memory after use (`memset` zero after decryption)
- ‚úÖ Minimize time decrypted data stays in memory (re-encrypt on save)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited effectiveness (JavaScript/Electron memory management makes true zeroing difficult)

**Residual Risk**: Medium. If attacker has admin access, memory dumps are possible. Mitigation helps but isn't bulletproof.

---

#### 5. Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Dependencies)

**Threat**: Malicious code in npm dependencies exfiltrates data or keys

**Likelihood**: Low (rare, but high-profile incidents exist - e.g., event-stream hack)

**Impact**: High (complete compromise)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ Dependency scanning: Weekly `npm audit` in CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Lock file: `package-lock.json` ensures reproducible builds
- ‚úÖ Minimize dependencies: Only use well-known, audited libraries
- ‚úÖ Open source: Code is auditable by security researchers
- ‚úÖ Subresource Integrity: (Future) Pin dependency hashes

**Residual Risk**: Low but non-zero. Even audited packages can be compromised post-audit. Monitor security advisories.

---

#### 6. Application Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS)

**Threat**: Bugs in KnowledgeFlow allow attackers to read/modify data or execute code

**Likelihood**: Medium (common for web/desktop apps)

**Impact**: High (data exposure or compromise)

**Mitigation**:
- ‚úÖ **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (better-sqlite3 bindings, never string concatenation)
- ‚úÖ **XSS**: Sanitize Markdown rendering with DOMPurify, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- ‚úÖ **CSP**: Content Security Policy in Tauri webview prevents inline scripts
- ‚úÖ **Code Review**: Manual security review before each release
- ‚úÖ **Fuzzing**: (Future) Automated input fuzzing to find edge cases

**Residual Risk**: Medium. Bugs are inevitable. Mitigation: Fast patching, responsible disclosure policy.

---

### Threats Out of Scope

#### 7. Cloud Sync Interception (Not Applicable)

**Threat**: Man-in-the-middle attack on cloud sync
**Mitigation**: N/A - No cloud sync in MVP (fully offline)

#### 8. Multi-User Access Control (Not Applicable)

**Threat**: Unauthorized users on shared device accessing notes
**Mitigation**: N/A - Relies on Windows user account separation (OS responsibility)

#### 9. Screen Capture / Shoulder Surfing

**Threat**: Attacker physically observes screen or uses screen recording malware
**Mitigation**: Out of scope (user responsibility to secure physical environment)

---

## Compliance & Legal

**GDPR** (Europe):
- ‚úÖ **Right to Access**: User can export all data
- ‚úÖ **Right to Erasure**: User can delete all data
- ‚úÖ **Data Portability**: Export as JSON or Markdown
- ‚úÖ **Consent**: Telemetry is opt-in (explicit consent required)
- ‚úÖ **Data Minimization**: Collect only what's necessary
- ‚úÖ **Local Processing**: No data transfers to third parties

**CCPA** (California):
- ‚úÖ **No Sale of Data**: Not applicable (no data collected unless telemetry enabled)
- ‚úÖ **Disclosure**: Privacy policy clearly states what data is collected
- ‚úÖ **Deletion**: User can delete all data

**Note**: Since app is local-only with no servers, most data protection regulations don't apply (no "data controller" or "data processor"). However, principles align with best practices.

## User Education

### FAQ: "Is My Data Safe?"

**Q: How is my data encrypted?**
A: We use AES-256-GCM, the same encryption standard used by governments and banks. Your notes are encrypted before being saved to disk. Decryption keys are protected by Windows DPAPI or your passphrase.

**Q: Can you (the developers) read my notes?**
A: No. All data stays on your device. We have no servers, no accounts, no way to access your notes. Even if we wanted to (we don't), it's technically impossible.

**Q: What if I forget my passphrase?**
A: If you're using passphrase mode and forget your passphrase, your data is **permanently unrecoverable**. This is by design (we can't add a "backdoor" without compromising security). We strongly recommend using a password manager.

**Q: Is it safe to use cloud backup (OneDrive, Dropbox) with KnowledgeFlow?**
A: Your database is encrypted, so even if it syncs to the cloud, the content is protected. However, we recommend excluding the KnowledgeFlow folder from cloud backup for maximum privacy. Instructions: [Link to FAQ].

**Q: Can malware steal my notes?**
A: If your computer has malware with admin privileges, it could potentially read your notes (by logging keystrokes or dumping memory). This is true for any app, not just KnowledgeFlow. Best protection: Keep your OS updated, use antivirus, avoid suspicious downloads.

**Q: Is telemetry safe?**
A: Telemetry is OFF by default. If you enable it, we only collect anonymous usage stats and error logs (no note content). You can view exactly what's sent in Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí "View Last Payload."

## Open Source & Auditability

**Repository**: https://github.com/knowledgeflow/knowledgeflow (hypothetical)

**License**: MIT (open-source, auditable by anyone)

**Build Reproducibility**:
- Locked dependencies (`package-lock.json`)
- Deterministic build process (documented in CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Checksum verification (SHA256 hashes published with releases)

**Why Open Source Matters for Privacy**:
- **Transparency**: Anyone can audit code for backdoors or vulnerabilities
- **Trust**: "Don't trust, verify" - users can compile from source
- **Community Security**: More eyes on code = faster bug discovery

---

## Future Enhancements

### v1.5: Hardware Key Support (YubiKey)
- Use YubiKey or other FIDO2 devices for encryption key storage
- More secure than DPAPI or passphrase (key never leaves hardware)

### v2.0: Optional Encrypted Cloud Sync
- End-to-end encrypted sync (keys never sent to server)
- Zero-knowledge architecture (server cannot decrypt data)
- Users who value cross-device sync can opt-in without sacrificing privacy

### v3.0: Multi-User / Team Edition
- Encrypted collaboration (shared encryption keys via secure exchange)
- Access control (read-only vs. edit permissions)
- Audit logs (who accessed what, when)

---

## Conclusion

**KnowledgeFlow prioritizes privacy by design**:
- ‚úÖ Offline-first (no network required)
- ‚úÖ Local-only storage (no cloud, no servers)
- ‚úÖ Encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- ‚úÖ User control (all features toggleable)
- ‚úÖ Data minimization (collect only what's necessary)
- ‚úÖ Open source (auditable by anyone)

**Residual Risks** (unavoidable):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OS-level malware (outside app's control)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Physical device theft (mitigated by encryption, but keys may be vulnerable if weak passphrase)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User error (syncing to cloud, weak passphrase, etc.)

**User Responsibility**:
- Use strong passphrase (if not using DPAPI)
- Keep OS and antivirus updated
- Disable cloud backup for app folder (if maximum privacy desired)
- Backup database to secure location (external drive, not cloud)

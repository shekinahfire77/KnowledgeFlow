# Problem Hypotheses

## Overview
These hypotheses are falsifiable statements about user problems, behaviors, and needs. Each must be validated or invalidated through user research before proceeding with product development.

---

## H1: Context-Switching Time Loss

**Statement**: Knowledge workers using 3+ separate note-taking or productivity tools lose at least 30 minutes per day to context-switching overhead and navigation between applications.

**Signal to validate**: Interview participants can describe specific instances and estimate time lost. Time-tracking or diary study data shows measurable switching costs.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 60% of interviewed users report losing 25+ minutes daily to tool switching, with ability to cite recent examples.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users report switching takes negligible time (under 10 minutes daily) or they have effective workarounds that minimize friction. Users cannot recall specific instances of time loss.

## H2: Privacy Concerns Block Adoption

**Statement**: Privacy and data sovereignty concerns prevent at least 40% of target users from adopting cloud-based note-taking solutions, creating demand for local-first alternatives.

**Signal to validate**: Users explicitly mention privacy as a decision criterion. Users have rejected cloud tools specifically due to data concerns. Users currently use local-only tools despite limitations.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 40% of screener respondents rate privacy importance as 8+ out of 10. At least 30% of interview participants cite privacy as a primary tool selection factor.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users express comfort with cloud storage. Privacy ranks low in stated priorities. Users already use cloud tools without concern.

## H3: Manual Linking Creates Abandonment

**Statement**: Users abandon comprehensive note-linking practices because manually creating and maintaining connections requires excessive effort relative to perceived value, leading to fragmented knowledge bases.

**Signal to validate**: Users describe starting with linking intentions but abandoning the practice. Existing note repositories have sparse links despite rich content. Users express frustration with link maintenance.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 50% of users who have tried linking tools report abandoning consistent linking practices. Users can describe specific points where linking became burdensome.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users maintain extensive linked note systems successfully. Manual linking is described as valuable and sustainable. Users have developed effective habits.

## H4: Insight Discovery Failure

**Statement**: Users fail to rediscover valuable insights and connections in their own notes because current tools lack semantic search and relationship surfacing, causing repeated research and lost value.

**Signal to validate**: Users describe "I know I wrote about this somewhere" experiences weekly. Users re-research topics they have notes on. Search yields irrelevant results despite relevant content existing.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 70% of users report weekly instances of failing to find notes they know exist. Users rate current search effectiveness as 6 or below out of 10.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users reliably find information when needed. Search and organization methods work effectively. Users rarely experience "lost note" frustration.

## H5: Offline Capability Is Critical

**Statement**: At least 30% of target users experience regular situations (travel, security requirements, unreliable connectivity) where offline capability is essential rather than merely convenient.

**Signal to validate**: Users describe specific contexts requiring offline work. Security policies prohibit cloud access in work environments. Travel or remote work creates offline needs.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 30% of interview participants can describe scenarios in past month where offline access was necessary. At least 20% work in environments with cloud restrictions.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users report always having reliable connectivity. Offline scenarios are hypothetical rather than actual. Users successfully work around connectivity needs.

## H6: Willingness-to-Pay Threshold

**Statement**: At least 50% of users experiencing severe pain (rated 7+ out of 10) with current solutions are willing to pay between $5-15 per month or $50-120 one-time for a solution addressing their core problems.

**Signal to validate**: Users currently pay for note-taking tools. Users express willingness to switch for better solution at stated price points. Users describe current pain as worth solving.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 50% of users with pain scores 7+ select $5-15/month or $50-120 one-time in willingness-to-pay questions. At least 30% currently pay for note tools.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users unwilling to pay for note-taking tools. Free alternatives deemed sufficient. Price sensitivity thresholds below $5/month.

## H7: Automation Value Perception

**Statement**: Users perceive automated tagging, linking, and task extraction as high-value features worth adopting new tools for, rather than as intrusive or unreliable.

**Signal to validate**: Users express frustration with manual tagging and organization. Users describe desire for automatic categorization. Users react positively to automation feature descriptions.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 60% of users rate automated organization features as "very valuable" or "essential" when described. Users cite manual organization as current pain point.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users prefer manual control over automation. Trust concerns about automated decisions. Satisfaction with current manual processes.

## H8: Windows Platform Viability

**Statement**: Windows users represent a viable and underserved market segment for premium desktop note-taking tools, with at least 40% of target users primarily using Windows machines.

**Signal to validate**: Screener responses show Windows as primary OS. Users describe Windows-specific workflows. Market research confirms Windows usage in target segments.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 40% of qualified screener respondents use Windows as primary platform. Windows users express desire for native desktop tools.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Target users primarily on macOS. Windows users prefer web-based tools. Platform-specific features not valued.

## H9: Import Capability Requirements

**Statement**: Users will not adopt new note-taking tools unless they can import existing content from at least their top 2-3 current tools, making import capability a table-stakes feature rather than enhancement.

**Signal to validate**: Users describe previous tool switches. Import capability cited as adoption requirement. Users have years of existing notes they cannot abandon.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 70% of users state import from current tools as essential or very important adoption criteria. Users can identify specific formats requiring import.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users willing to start fresh with new tool. Existing notes not valuable enough to require migration. Manual migration acceptable.

## H10: Graph Complexity Threshold

**Statement**: Graph visualizations provide value for networks of 50-500 nodes but become overwhelming and unused beyond 1000+ nodes without filtering and focus capabilities.

**Signal to validate**: Users who have tried graph tools describe experience. Visualization preferences and usage patterns emerge. Complexity thresholds identified.

**Evidence threshold**: At least 50% of users with graph tool experience describe overwhelming complexity at scale. Users request filtering or focus features.

**Disconfirming evidence**: Users effectively use large-scale graphs. Complexity not cited as issue. Full graph view preferred over filtered views.

## Validation Approach

These hypotheses will be tested through:
1. Screener survey quantitative data (Nâ‰¥25)
2. Semi-structured interviews (N=10) with narrative exploration
3. Analysis of current tool usage patterns and pain points
4. Willingness-to-pay and feature prioritization exercises

## Decision Criteria

**Proceed**: At least 6 of 10 hypotheses validated above evidence thresholds

**Hold**: 4-5 hypotheses validated, requiring deeper investigation

**Pivot**: Fewer than 4 hypotheses validated, indicating fundamental assumptions are incorrect

## 1. Validation Objectives

Stage 2 validates hypotheses H1-H10 from Stage 1 through quantitative and qualitative user research.

### Hypothesis Mapping

**H1 (Context-switching):**
Validate that knowledge workers lose 30+ minutes per day switching between note-taking tools.

**H2 (Privacy):**
Confirm that 40%+ of potential users are blocked from adopting cloud-first tools due to privacy concerns.

**H3 (Manual linking):**
Test the thesis that manual bidirectional linking is tedious enough to cause abandonment.

**H4 (Insight discovery):**
Measure the failure rate for users attempting to discover connections across their own notes.

**H5 (Offline):**
Validate that offline-first functionality is critical for target segments, not merely a nice-to-have.

**H6 (Willingness to Pay):**
Confirm that the $5-15/month price range aligns with user expectations and perceived value.

**H7 (Automation):**
Test whether users value AI-powered automation (auto-linking, tagging, summarization) over manual control.

**H8 (Windows):**
Validate that Windows as a primary platform represents a viable and underserved market segment.

**H9 (Import):**
Test whether seamless data import from existing tools is a requirement or a preference.

**H10 (Graph complexity):**
Determine the threshold of complexity at which knowledge graph visualization becomes overwhelming versus helpful.

## 2. Primary Research Questions

**Frequency:**
How often do users experience note fragmentation across multiple tools? (Daily, weekly, monthly, or project-triggered?)

**Severity:**
How painful is the current state of fragmented note-taking on a 1-10 scale? What is the median pain severity?

**Switching Intent:**
Would users switch to a privacy-first, local-first solution if it addressed their core pain points?

**Privacy Importance:**
How critical is local-first architecture compared to collaboration and cloud convenience?

**Willingness to Pay:**
What price range is acceptable for a solution that eliminates fragmentation and provides AI-powered automation?

## 3. Target Segments and Quotas

| Segment | Description | Target Interviews | % of Total |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| Research Analyst Rachel | Corporate researchers, consultants, analysts handling sensitive client data | 3+ | 30% |
| Freelance Creator Finn | Freelancers, content creators, multi-project managers | 3+ | 30% |
| Graduate Student Gia | Graduate students, academics conducting literature reviews | 2+ | 20% |
| Other Knowledge Workers | Additional qualified participants not fitting above archetypes | 2+ | 20% |
| **Total** | | **10** | **100%** |

**Screener Survey Target:** N ≥ 40 qualified respondents

**Qualification Criteria:**
- Windows as primary OS (≥80% of work time)
- Takes notes weekly or more frequently
- Uses ≥2 separate note-taking tools
- Self-reported pain severity ≥6/10
- 18+ years old, fluent in English

## 4. Success Thresholds

We define success using six critical thresholds. Meeting ≥5 of 6 triggers a GO decision.

| Threshold | Target | Measurement Method |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Problem Frequency** | ≥70% experience weekly collisions | Interview question: "How often do you struggle to find notes or lose context switching between tools?" |
| **Pain Severity (Median)** | ≥7/10 | Interview question: "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is your current note-taking workflow?" |
| **Pain Severity (High Pain %)** | ≥60% rate pain at 7-10/10 | Distribution analysis of pain scores |
| **Switching Intent** | ≥50% likely or very likely (4-5 on 5-point scale) | Interview question: "How likely would you be to switch to a tool that solved these problems?" |
| **WTP Median** | $5-10/month | Interview question: "What would you pay per month for a solution that eliminated these pain points?" |
| **WTP Premium** | ≥30% willing to pay ≥$7/month | Distribution analysis of stated WTP |
| **Privacy Importance** | ≥60% rate privacy 7-10/10 | Interview question: "How important is it that your notes stay on your own computer?" |
| **Differentiator Resonance** | ≥70% mention semantic/automation as key value | Qualitative analysis of concept card reactions |

## 5. Decision Rule

**GO (Proceed to Stage 3 - Solution Definition):**
≥5 of 6 thresholds met, strong evidence of product-market fit

**HOLD (Revise and Retest):**
3-4 thresholds met, mixed signals requiring deeper investigation or repositioning

**PIVOT (Alternate Segment or Value Proposition):**
≤2 thresholds met, fundamental misalignment between problem, solution, and target market

## 6. Timeline

**Duration:** 14 days (November 1-14, 2025)

**Key Milestones:**
- Day 1 (Nov 1): Launch screener survey, begin recruitment
- Day 4 (Nov 4): Close screener, select participants
- Days 6-11 (Nov 6-11): Conduct 10 interviews
- Day 13 (Nov 13): Complete analysis and dashboard
- Day 14 (Nov 14): Decision memo and final review

---

## 7. Research Methods

**Screener Survey:** Quantitative filter to identify qualified participants (N ≥ 40)

**Semi-Structured Interviews:** Deep qualitative exploration with 10 selected participants (35-40 minutes each)

**Mixed Methods Rationale:** Screener provides breadth and quota management; interviews provide depth and context for pain points, WTP, and switching triggers.

---

## 8. Deliverables

- Screener response dataset (≥40 qualified)
- 10 interview transcripts or detailed notes
- Codebook and coded excerpts
- Affinity map of themes
- Quantitative analysis vs thresholds
- Validation dashboard
- Analysis report
- Decision memo (Go/Hold/Pivot)
- Updated personas and value proposition

# Research Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the user research activities for Stage 1 validation of KnowledgeFlow. The goal is to validate or invalidate problem hypotheses before proceeding with technical development.

---

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Validate pain severity**: Confirm target users experience significant pain (≥7/10) with current note-taking solutions sufficient to motivate tool switching.

2. **Test problem hypotheses**: Gather evidence to validate or invalidate the 10 hypotheses documented in 02-problem-hypotheses.md, particularly around context-switching time loss, privacy concerns, and insight discovery failure.

3. **Understand user workflows**: Map current tools, processes, pain points, and workarounds to identify intervention opportunities and feature priorities.

4. **Assess willingness to pay**: Determine price sensitivity and acceptable business models (subscription vs one-time) across target segments.

5. **Refine personas and positioning**: Validate or adjust persona characteristics and value proposition messaging based on real user language and priorities.

## Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Analysis (Screener Data)

**Descriptive Statistics**:
- Pain severity: Mean, median, distribution
- Privacy importance: Mean, median, distribution
- Tool count: Frequency distribution
- Platform breakdown: Windows vs other OS percentages
- Demographic characteristics across archetypes

**Hypothesis Testing**:
- H2: Privacy concerns - % rating privacy ≥8/10
- H5: Offline needs - % reporting offline scenarios
- H6: Willingness to pay - Distribution across price brackets
- H8: Windows viability - % using Windows as primary OS

**Quota Achievement**:
- Assess whether target archetype distribution achieved
- Identify any sampling biases to address

---

### Qualitative Analysis (Interview Data)

**Thematic Coding**:
1. Read all transcripts for immersion
2. Code pain points using open coding (bottom-up themes)
3. Map themes to hypotheses (deductive validation)
4. Identify emergent themes not captured in hypotheses
5. Note memorable quotes and specific examples

**Pain Point Analysis**:
- Frequency: How many participants mention each pain?
- Severity: Self-reported 1-10 scores for each pain
- Specificity: Can participants give concrete recent examples?
- Impact: Quantified time/money/frustration costs
- Priority: What would users most want solved first?

**Workflow Mapping**:
- Current tool ecosystem for each participant
- Information flow across tools
- Manual processes and workarounds
- Breaking points where systems fail
- Triggers that would prompt tool switching

**Feature Validation**:
- Reaction to semantic graph concept
- Value perception of automation features
- Importance of privacy/offline vs other attributes
- Must-have vs nice-to-have features
- Deal-breaker concerns or objections

**Willingness-to-Pay Analysis**:
- Stated price ranges by participant
- Bucket distribution: <$5/mo, $5-15/mo, $15-30/mo, >$30/mo, one-time preferred
- Correlation with pain severity and persona type
- Price objections and sensitivity factors
- Comparison to current tool spending

---

## Hypothesis Validation Criteria

For each hypothesis in 02-problem-hypotheses.md, assess:

1. **Evidence Collected**: What data speaks to this hypothesis?
2. **Threshold Achievement**: Does evidence meet or exceed stated threshold?
3. **Disconfirming Evidence**: What data contradicts the hypothesis?
4. **Verdict**: Validated, Invalidated, or Inconclusive
5. **Confidence**: High, Medium, Low based on signal strength

**Validation Requirements**:
- Quantitative thresholds must be met (e.g., ≥60% for H1, ≥40% for H2)
- Qualitative evidence must include specific examples, not just agreement
- Disconfirming evidence must be considered and reconciled
- Inconclusive results require explanation and follow-up plan

---

## Decision Gates

### Go Decision Criteria
Proceed with product development if:
- ≥ 6 of 10 hypotheses validated above evidence thresholds
- ≥ 60% of interview participants report pain severity ≥7/10
- ≥ 50% express willingness to pay $5-15/month or equivalent one-time
- ≥ 40% use Windows as primary platform
- No critical disconfirming evidence on core assumptions
- Clear feature priorities emerge from research

**Action**: Proceed to Stage 2 (technical planning and prototyping)

---

### Hold Decision Criteria
Pause for deeper investigation if:
- 4-5 of 10 hypotheses validated (partial validation)
- Pain scores 5-7/10 (moderate but not severe)
- Willingness to pay unclear or below thresholds
- Windows segment viable but smaller than expected
- Mixed signals requiring resolution

**Action**: Conduct follow-up research to resolve ambiguities before proceeding

---

### Pivot Decision Criteria
Reconsider or pivot product concept if:
- < 4 of 10 hypotheses validated (fundamental assumptions wrong)
- Pain scores < 5/10 (insufficient motivation to switch)
- Willingness to pay < $5/month majority
- Windows segment < 30% of target users
- Strong preference for collaboration over privacy emerges
- Alternative problem space appears more compelling

**Action**: Reassess product concept, target market, or problem focus

---

## Data Management

### Collection and Storage
- Screener responses: Google Forms/Typeform, export to CSV
- Interview recordings: Local encrypted storage, deleted after transcription
- Transcripts: Anonymized, stored in secure project folder
- Analysis notes: Research lead personal encrypted notebook
- Retention: 1 year, then deleted per consent agreement

### Privacy and Ethics
- All participants sign consent form (see 11-consent-and-privacy.md)
- No PII published or shared outside research team
- Participants identified by ID numbers in analysis (P001, P002, etc.)
- Transcripts reviewed by participants upon request
- Right to withdraw participation and delete data honored

### Quality Assurance
- Pilot test screener with 2-3 volunteers before launch
- Pilot test interview guide with 1 practice interview
- Review first 2 interview transcripts for question refinement
- Track recruitment metrics to adjust strategy if needed
- Monitor for sampling bias and correct through targeted recruitment

---

## Contingency Plans

**Insufficient Screener Responses**:
- Extend survey period by 2-3 days
- Expand to additional Reddit communities
- Leverage personal networks for shares
- Consider small paid promotion on Reddit or Twitter

**Interview Cancellations or No-Shows**:
- Over-recruit by 20% (12 scheduled for 10 completed)
- Maintain backup candidates from screener
- Offer flexible scheduling including evenings and weekends
- Send reminders 24 hours and 2 hours before interviews

**Quota Imbalance**:
- Adjust recruitment messaging to target underrepresented archetypes
- Accept slight quota deviation if sample quality high
- Document bias and account for in analysis

**Timeline Delays**:
- Buffer days built into schedule (Nov 8-10)
- Can compress analysis phase if needed (parallel work)
- Decision gate can extend 1-2 days if necessary

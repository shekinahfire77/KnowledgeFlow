**IQR (25th-75th percentile):** $[#] - $[#]/month

**Chart:** See `/data/artifacts/wtp-distribution.png`

---

### Price Sensitivity Factors

**Higher WTP correlated with:**
1. [Factor 1 - e.g., "Privacy importance (r = 0.XX, participants rating privacy 9-10/10 had median WTP of $X)"]
2. [Factor 2 - e.g., "Pain severity (participants with pain ≥8/10 had median WTP of $X vs $Y for pain 6-7)"]
3. [Factor 3 - e.g., "Time lost (participants losing >1hr/day had median WTP of $X)"]

**Lower WTP correlated with:**
1. [Factor 1 - e.g., "Student status (Gia segment had median WTP of $X vs overall median of $Y)"]
2. [Factor 2 - e.g., "Number of free alternatives used (participants using Obsidian [free] had lower WTP)"]
3. [Factor 3]

---

### Pricing Implications

**Recommended initial price:** $[#]/month

**Rationale:**
- [Why this price point? e.g., "Aligns with median WTP ($X) and captures X% of target market"]
- [Competitive positioning - e.g., "Premium to Obsidian (free) but below Notion ($10)"]
- [Value justification - e.g., "Median participant loses Xmin/day = $Y/month in time"]

**Freemium vs Paid-Only:**
[Recommendation: Freemium / Paid-only / Freemium with time-limited trial]

**Rationale:**
[Based on data - e.g., "X% would try free first before paying, but Y% said they'd pay immediately if it solved their problem"]

**Student Discount:**
[Recommendation: Yes / No]

**Rationale:**
[e.g., "Gia segment median WTP is $X vs $Y overall, suggesting 50% discount to $Z/month for students"]

## 6. RISKS UPDATE AND MITIGATIONS

### Risks Elevated (Worse Than Expected)

**[Risk ID from /docs/07-risk-log.md - e.g., R05]:** [Risk name - e.g., "Cloud privacy concerns"]

**Original assessment:** Likelihood [Low/Med/High], Impact [Low/Med/High]
**Updated assessment:** Likelihood [Higher], Impact [Higher]

**Why elevated:**
[Evidence from interviews - e.g., "8/10 participants mentioned data breach fears; 3 explicitly said cloud storage is a dealbreaker for client work"]

**New mitigation:**
[Updated plan - e.g., "Emphasize local-first + encryption in messaging; consider on-prem option for enterprise"]

---

[Repeat for each elevated risk]

---

### Risks Reduced (Better Than Expected)

**[Risk ID - e.g., R03]:** [Risk name]

**Original assessment:** Likelihood [High], Impact [High]
**Updated assessment:** Likelihood [Lower], Impact [Lower]

**Why reduced:**
[Evidence - e.g., "No participants mentioned AI accuracy concerns; 7/10 were enthusiastic about local AI"]

**Updated mitigation:**
[Can we deprioritize this mitigation?]

---

[Repeat for each reduced risk]

---

### New Risks Identified

**[New Risk ID - e.g., R13]:** [Risk name - e.g., "Import capability is dealbreaker"]

**Likelihood:** [Low / Medium / High]
**Impact:** [Low / Medium / High]
**Priority:** [Low / Medium / High / Critical]

**Description:**
[What is the risk? - e.g., "40% of participants said seamless import from Notion/Obsidian is a dealbreaker. If we don't support import, they won't switch despite pain."]

**Evidence:**
> "[Quote from participant]"
> — P###

**Proposed mitigation:**
[What should we do? - e.g., "Prioritize import feature in MVP; build Notion and Obsidian importers first; test with beta users before launch"]

**Pricing Structure:**

**Option 1: Paid-only**
- Single tier: $[#]/month
- Pros: [e.g., "Simple, focuses on serious users, no freemium support burden"]
- Cons: [e.g., "Higher barrier to trial"]

**Option 2: Freemium**
- Free tier: [Limited features - which ones?]
- Paid tier: $[#]/month
- Pros: [e.g., "Lower barrier to adoption, builds user base"]
- Cons: [e.g., "Majority may not convert"]

**Recommended:** [Option 1 or 2]

**Student Pricing:** [Yes / No]
- If yes: $[#]/month ([##]% discount)
- Rationale: [Gia segment WTP + market expansion]

---

#### Platform Priority

**Primary platform:** Windows desktop (confirmed)

**Evidence:**
- [X]/10 participants use Windows as primary
- [No participants requested macOS/Linux first]
- [Validate H8: Windows viability]

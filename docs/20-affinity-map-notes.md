## Purpose

This document synthesizes coded interview data into higher-level themes and opportunity areas. After coding all 10 interviews with the codebook, cluster codes and quotes to identify patterns that inform product strategy.

---

## Instructions

1. **After coding all 10 interviews**, export code frequency data
2. **Group related codes** into thematic clusters (3-6 per category below)
3. **Extract representative quotes** for each cluster
4. **Compute frequency** (X/10 participants mentioned)
5. **Link to product pillars** (Semantic, Automation, Privacy, Offline)
6. **Identify opportunities** for differentiation

## Cross-Segment Patterns

### Pain Points by Segment

| Pain Cluster | Rachel (Research) | Finn (Freelance) | Gia (Student) | Other |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| [Cluster 1 name] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |
| [Cluster 2 name] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |
| [Cluster 3 name] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |

**Insights:**
- [Which segment feels which pain most acutely?]
- [Are there segment-specific pains or universal pains?]
- [Should we prioritize one segment's pain over another?]

---

### Feature Prioritization by Segment

| Feature/Outcome | Rachel | Finn | Gia | Other |
|-----------------|--------|------|-----|-------|
| Auto-linking | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |
| Privacy/Local | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |
| Graph visualization | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |
| Offline-first | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |
| Import from existing | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] |

**Insights:**
- [Which features are universal vs segment-specific?]
- [Should we build different versions or a single flexible product?]

---

## Willingness to Pay Patterns

### WTP by Pain Severity

**Hypothesis:** Higher pain → higher WTP

**Analysis:**
- Participants with pain ≥8/10: Median WTP = $[X]/month
- Participants with pain 6-7/10: Median WTP = $[X]/month
- Correlation: [Strong / Moderate / Weak]

**Quotes linking pain to value:**
> "[Quote showing participant would pay more because pain is severe]"

---

### WTP by Segment

| Segment | Median WTP | Range | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|-------|
| Rachel (Research) | $[X]/mo | $[X]-$[Y] | [Willingness drivers] |
| Finn (Freelance) | $[X]/mo | $[X]-$[Y] | [Willingness drivers] |
| Gia (Student) | $[X]/mo | $[X]-$[Y] | [Willingness drivers - likely lower] |
| Other | $[X]/mo | $[X]-$[Y] | [Willingness drivers] |

**Insights:**
- [Should we have student pricing?]
- [Is there a "premium" segment willing to pay >$15/month?]

---

### WTP by Feature Enthusiasm

**Hypothesis:** Participants excited about automation/semantic features → higher WTP

**Analysis:**
- Participants who mentioned AUTO-001 or GRAPH-001: Median WTP = $[X]/month
- Participants who didn't: Median WTP = $[X]/month
- Difference: [Significant / Marginal / None]

**Quotes linking features to value:**
> "[Quote showing participant would pay for specific features]"

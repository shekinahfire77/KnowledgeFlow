# User Personas (Draft)

## Overview
These personas represent archetypal target users for KnowledgeFlow. They are hypotheses to be validated and refined through user research.

---

## Persona 1: Research Analyst Rachel

### Demographics
- **Age**: 32
- **Role**: Market Research Analyst at mid-size consulting firm
- **Location**: Urban area, works hybrid (office 3 days, remote 2 days)
- **Education**: MBA
- **Tech comfort**: High, early adopter of productivity tools
- **Work environment**: Windows laptop (company-issued), dual monitors at office

### Goals
- Synthesize insights from 20-40 sources per project across industry reports, competitor analysis, and client interviews
- Maintain context across 4-6 simultaneous client projects
- Produce comprehensive reports with cited sources and clear recommendations
- Build reusable knowledge base of industry trends and frameworks
- Respond quickly to ad-hoc information requests from senior partners

### Frustrations
- Loses 45 minutes daily switching between Evernote (capture), Excel (tracking), OneNote (project folders), and PowerPoint (outputs)
- Cannot remember which project a valuable insight came from when needed three months later
- Search across tools yields irrelevant results despite knowing the information exists
- Privacy concerns about storing client-confidential information in cloud tools
- Manual citation tracking is error-prone and time-consuming
- Rigid folder hierarchies break down when projects evolve or combine

### Current Tools
- **Capture**: Evernote (web clipper, meeting notes)
- **Organization**: OneNote (project folders)
- **Analysis**: Excel spreadsheets (tracking themes, sources)
- **Output**: PowerPoint, Word
- **Communication**: Outlook, Teams
- **Tried but abandoned**: Notion (team rejected), Roam (too complex), Obsidian (insufficient structure)

### Triggers (What Makes Her Search for New Tool)
- Missed a critical insight in client presentation because could not find note despite extensive searching
- Security audit flagged concerns about confidential data in consumer cloud services
- New project requires synthesizing findings from three previous projects with no easy way to cross-reference
- Colleague at another firm demos their knowledge management system and Rachel feels behind

### Selection Criteria
1. **Privacy and security**: Must support local storage for confidential client data
2. **Search quality**: Must find information reliably across large note corpus
3. **Cross-project synthesis**: Must surface connections between related work
4. **Professional appearance**: Must produce outputs suitable for client delivery
5. **Import capability**: Must bring in 4 years of existing Evernote and OneNote content
6. **Reliability**: Must be stable tool from credible company, not side project

### Memorable Quote
"I spend more time managing my notes than actually thinking about what they mean. I know the insights are in there somewhere, but finding them is like searching for a specific grain of sand on a beach."

### Expected Pain Score: 8/10
### Expected Willingness to Pay: $10-15/month or $100-150 one-time
### Interview Target: 5 participants matching this archetype

- **Tried but abandoned**: Evernote (too expensive), Obsidian (confused by graph), Roam (weird pricing)

### Triggers (What Makes Him Search for New Tool)
- Missed deadline because could not access Notion during flight to client meeting

- Spent 30 minutes searching for research note about client preference, eventually gave up and re-researched
- Another freelancer describes their workflow and Finn realizes his is inefficient

### Selection Criteria
1. **Offline capability**: Must work fully without internet connection

1. Used to design screener questions and quota targets
2. Referenced during interview recruitment to ensure diversity
3. Refined based on actual participant characteristics and needs

## Research Targets

- **Total interviews**: 10
- **Rachel archetype**: 5 participants (corporate researchers, analysts)

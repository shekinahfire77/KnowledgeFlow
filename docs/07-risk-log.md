## Detailed Risk Profiles

### R01: Competitive Feature Parity

**Category**: Market / Competition

**Description**: Established competitors (especially Obsidian with plugins or Notion with offline mode) could release local AI features before KnowledgeFlow launches, eliminating our primary differentiator.

**Current Likelihood**: Medium
- Obsidian plugin ecosystem could add AI capabilities
- Microsoft has resources to enhance OneNote significantly
- Notion has discussed offline improvements publicly

**Current Impact**: High
- Removes primary competitive advantage
- Requires repositioning or pivoting value proposition
- May reduce willingness to switch if existing tools gain features

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Accelerate development timeline to reach market quickly
2. Focus on integrated experience versus piecemeal plugins
3. Leverage Windows-specific optimizations competitors cannot easily match
4. Build features beyond core AI (e.g., task automation, calendar integration)
5. Establish user community and loyalty before competition intensifies

**Owner**: product-lead

**Status**: Active monitoring of competitor roadmaps and announcements

**Decision Rule:**
- GO: ≥5 of 6 core thresholds met (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- HOLD: 3-4 thresholds met
- PIVOT: ≤2 thresholds met

**Result:** [Thresholds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8: [#]/6 met] → [GO / HOLD / PIVOT]

---

## DECISION RATIONALE

### Why GO [if applicable]

**Primary reason:**
[1-2 sentences - e.g., "Strong validation across all critical thresholds: pain is severe (median 8.5/10), frequent (90% weekly), and users are willing to pay ($8/month median). Differentiation strategy resonates (85% mentioned auto-linking as key value)."]

**Supporting evidence from thresholds:**
1. [Threshold result 1 - e.g., "Pain severity 8.5/10 significantly exceeds target of 7/10"]
2. [Threshold result 2 - e.g., "80% willing to switch, vs 50% target"]
3. [Threshold result 3 - e.g., "WTP median $8/month in range, 60% willing to pay ≥$7"]

**Qualitative insights from interviews:**
- [Insight 1 - e.g., "Privacy concerns are even more acute than hypothesized; 8/10 participants mentioned data breach fears"]
- [Insight 2 - e.g., "Auto-linking resonates as 'magic moment' - fills gap left by manual Obsidian linking"]
- [Insight 3 - e.g., "Import capability emerged as critical (not in original hypotheses) - 6/10 said dealbreaker"]

**Risk assessment:**
- [Risk status - e.g., "Manageable risks; no showstoppers identified"]
- [Mitigation confidence - e.g., "Import complexity can be addressed with focused MVP scope"]

---

### Why HOLD [if applicable]

**Primary reason:**
[e.g., "Mixed results across thresholds (4/6 met); strong pain validation but weak switching intent suggests messaging or feature set needs refinement before proceeding"]

**Threshold gaps:**
1. [Missed threshold 1 - e.g., "Switching intent only 42% vs 50% target - barrier analysis needed"]
2. [Missed threshold 2 - e.g., "WTP median $4/month vs $5-10 target - value prop not resonating"]

**What needs retesting:**
1. [Retest 1 - e.g., "Value proposition messaging - test alternate framings"]
2. [Retest 2 - e.g., "Feature prioritization - test with prototype/mockup"]
3. [Retest 3 - e.g., "Pricing anchor - test $5 vs $8 vs $10 explicitly"]

**Revised approach:**
[How we'll address gaps - e.g., "Conduct 5 additional interviews with concept variants to test messaging"]

**Timeline for retest:**
[Date range - e.g., "Nov 20-30, 2025; reconvene for decision Dec 2"]

---

### Why PIVOT [if applicable]

**Primary reason:**
[e.g., "Fundamental misalignment: pain is real but not severe enough (median 5/10), WTP too low ($2/month), and differentiation features not resonating - suggests wrong segment or value proposition"]

**Threshold failures:**
1. [Failed threshold 1]
2. [Failed threshold 2]
3. [Failed threshold 3]

**New direction:**
**Target segment:** [Which audience instead? e.g., "Enterprise knowledge workers (legal, healthcare) with compliance needs, not individual consumers"]

**Value proposition:** [What problem to solve instead? e.g., "Compliance-first knowledge management (HIPAA, SOC2) rather than personal productivity"]

**Evidence for pivot:**
- [Evidence 1 - e.g., "3/10 participants mentioned regulatory compliance as bigger pain than productivity"]
- [Evidence 2 - e.g., "Enterprise segment has 10x higher WTP ($50-100/month) based on secondary mentions"]

**Next steps:**
1. [Step 1 - e.g., "Conduct 10 interviews with compliance-focused knowledge workers"]
2. [Step 2 - e.g., "Revise personas and hypotheses for enterprise segment"]
3. [Step 3 - e.g., "Retest with new value prop in 30 days"]

---

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**Confidence Level:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Reasons for confidence level:**

**If High:**
- [Reason 1 - e.g., "Large margin on all thresholds (not just barely passing)"]
- [Reason 2 - e.g., "Consistent findings across all 3 segments"]
- [Reason 3 - e.g., "Qualitative insights strongly align with quantitative data"]

**If Medium:**
- [Reason 1 - e.g., "Some thresholds barely met (within 5%)"]
- [Reason 2 - e.g., "Segment imbalance (only 1 Gia participant vs target of 2)"]
- [Reason 3 - e.g., "Conflicting signals (high pain but moderate switching intent)"]

**If Low:**
- [Reason 1 - e.g., "Small sample size (N=7 vs target N=10)"]
- [Reason 2 - e.g., "Wide variance in WTP ($0 to $30/month)"]
- [Reason 3 - e.g., "Unclear whether participants understood concept card"]

**What uncertainties remain:**
1. [Uncertainty 1 - e.g., "Will auto-linking AI be accurate enough to deliver value?"]
2. [Uncertainty 2 - e.g., "Will users actually switch or just express intent?"]
3. [Uncertainty 3 - e.g., "Can we build import feature within MVP timeline?"]

**What additional data would increase confidence:**
1. [Data need 1 - e.g., "Prototype testing with 5 participants to validate feature priority"]
2. [Data need 2 - e.g., "Competitive analysis of Obsidian + plugin usage vs standalone app preference"]
3. [Data need 3 - e.g., "Technical feasibility spike on AI accuracy for auto-linking"]

## REQUIRED CHANGES FOR STAGE 3

[Complete this section based on decision above]

### If GO: Required Changes

#### Product Changes

1. **[Change 1 - e.g., "Prioritize auto-linking over graph visualization"]**
   - Evidence: [e.g., "9/10 mentioned auto-linking vs 4/10 mentioned graph"]
   - Action: [e.g., "Move graph viz to v1.1, focus MVP on auto-suggestions"]

2. **[Change 2 - e.g., "Add Notion and Obsidian importers to MVP scope"]**
   - Evidence: [e.g., "6/10 said import is dealbreaker for switching"]
   - Action: [e.g., "Allocate 2 sprints to import feature development"]

3. **[Change 3 - e.g., "Delay collaboration features to v2"]**
   - Evidence: [e.g., "Only 1/10 mentioned collaboration; privacy segment prefers solo"]
   - Action: [e.g., "Remove from MVP roadmap, reassess post-launch"]

4. **[Change 4]**

5. **[Change 5]**

---

#### Positioning Changes

1. **[Change 1 - e.g., "Lead with privacy, not productivity"]**
   - Evidence: [e.g., "80% rated privacy 9-10/10; 'your data, your computer' resonated strongly"]
   - Action: [e.g., "Rewrite landing page headline and value prop"]

2. **[Change 2 - e.g., "Emphasize time savings with quantified claims"]**
   - Evidence: [e.g., "Median 45 min/day lost to context-switching; concrete number increases urgency"]
   - Action: [e.g., "Use '30+ minutes saved daily' in messaging"]

3. **[Change 3 - e.g., "Use participant language: 'connections' not 'links'"]**
   - Evidence: [e.g., "Participants naturally said 'discover connections' not 'create links'"]
   - Action: [e.g., "Update all marketing copy and UI labels"]

---

#### Persona Refinements

**Rachel (Research Analyst):**
1. [Refinement 1 - e.g., "Add GDPR/HIPAA compliance concern to pain points"]
2. [Refinement 2 - e.g., "Update WTP to $10-15/month (actual median for segment)"]
3. [Refinement 3 - e.g., "Change 'background quote' to actual quote from P001"]

**Finn (Freelance Creator):**
1. [Refinement 1]
2. [Refinement 2]

**Gia (Graduate Student):**
1. [Refinement 1 - e.g., "Reduce WTP estimate to $3-5/month (student constraints)"]
2. [Refinement 2 - e.g., "Add citation management pain (mentioned by all 2 Gia participants)"]

**See:** `/docs/04-user-personas-draft.md` - create v2 or update

---

#### Pricing

**Recommended launch price:** $[#]/month

**Rationale:**
- [Reason 1 - e.g., "Median WTP $8/month with 60% willing to pay ≥$7"]
- [Reason 2 - e.g., "Positions between Obsidian (free) and Notion ($10) with clear differentiation"]
- [Reason 3 - e.g., "ROI justification: saves 30+ min/day = $X/month value"]

**Freemium decision:** [Yes / No]

**If Yes:**
- Free tier: [Limited features - e.g., "50 notes max, no import, no AI features"]
- Paid tier: $[#]/month (full features)
- Conversion hypothesis: [e.g., "30% of free users convert within 60 days based on engagement"]

**If No:**
- Rationale: [e.g., "Focus on serious users; avoid support burden of free tier; 14-day trial instead"]

**Student pricing:** [Yes / No]
- If Yes: $[#]/month ([##]% discount)
- Rationale: [e.g., "Gia segment WTP $4/month vs $8 overall; offer $4/month student tier with .edu verification"]

---

#### Platform Priority

**Primary platform:** Windows desktop (reaffirmed)

**Evidence:**
- [e.g., "10/10 participants use Windows as primary; no requests for macOS-first"]

**Secondary platforms (defer to v2):**
1. [Platform 1 - e.g., "macOS"] - Priority: [Low / Medium / High]
2. [Platform 2 - e.g., "Mobile (capture only)"] - Priority: [Low / Medium / High]

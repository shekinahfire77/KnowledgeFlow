## D001: Focus Stage 1 on Validation

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: research-lead, product-lead
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Starting new product with limited validated understanding of user needs and market demand. Could begin with technical prototyping or customer discovery.

### Options Considered
1. **Immediate prototyping**: Build MVP with assumed features, validate later
2. **Validation-first**: Conduct thorough user research before any technical work
3. **Hybrid approach**: Light prototype alongside research
4. **Competitor analysis only**: Skip primary research, rely on secondary sources

### Decision Made
Commit to comprehensive validation phase (Stage 1) with zero technical development. Focus exclusively on problem validation through user research before building anything.

### Rationale
- High risk of building wrong solution if assumptions unvalidated
- Pivoting after development wastes time and resources
- Note-taking market is crowded; differentiation requires precise positioning
- User research findings will inform technical architecture decisions
- Two weeks of research costs less than one week of misdirected development
- Falsifiable hypotheses prevent confirmation bias

### Impact
- 2-week timeline before any code written
- Clear go/no-go decision gate based on evidence
- Reduced risk of product-market fit failure
- Delayed gratification for technical team
- Higher confidence in subsequent technical decisions
- Research artifacts reusable for marketing and positioning

## D002: Target Windows-First Platform

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: product-lead, tech-lead
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Cross-platform tools have larger addressable market but require more complex development. Need to choose initial platform focus.

### Options Considered
1. **Windows-first**: Native Windows desktop application initially
2. **Web-first**: Browser-based application (cross-platform by default)
3. **macOS-first**: Target Mac users (typical early adopter demographic)
4. **Cross-platform from start**: Electron or similar framework for all platforms
5. **Mobile-first**: iOS or Android primary platform

### Decision Made
Build native Windows desktop application first. Plan cross-platform expansion for year 2 only if Windows market proves viable.

### Rationale
- Windows represents largest desktop OS market share (70%+)
- Native Windows apps can leverage platform-specific optimizations
- Competitors (Obsidian, Notion) often prioritize Mac, leaving Windows underserved
- Offline and local AI features benefit from native platform access
- Focus allows higher quality single-platform experience versus compromised cross-platform
- Business users (target segment) predominantly on Windows
- Electron apps often criticized for performance; native is differentiator

### Impact
- Excludes Mac and Linux users initially (market size reduction)
- Development can use Windows-specific APIs and features
- Simpler initial architecture and testing surface
- Marketing message: "Built for Windows users, by Windows users"
- Hypothesis H8 becomes critical to validate in research
- May need to reassess if Windows segment too small or unwilling to pay

## D003: Prioritize Privacy/Offline Over Cloud Sync

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: product-lead, security-lead
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Modern productivity tools emphasize cloud sync and collaboration. Need to choose architectural direction for data storage and access.

### Options Considered
1. **Cloud-first**: All data synced through central servers (Notion model)
2. **Local-first with optional cloud**: Local by default, opt-in sync (Obsidian model)
3. **Pure local, no sync**: Local only, never touch cloud (DEVONthink model)
4. **Peer-to-peer sync**: Direct device-to-device encrypted sync (no central server)
5. **Hybrid**: Basic features local, advanced features cloud-dependent

### Decision Made
Build pure local-first architecture with no cloud features in version 1.0. Local AI processing, local search, local graph. Investigate encrypted peer-to-peer sync for future version only if user research validates demand.

### Rationale
- Privacy concerns are core differentiator versus Notion, Mem, and others
- Offline capability is table-stakes for target users (hypothesis H5)
- Local-first reduces operational costs (no server infrastructure initially)
- Eliminates data breach risk and compliance complexity
- Cloud sync increases development timeline and complexity significantly
- Can always add opt-in cloud later; removing cloud dependency later is architecturally difficult
- Market gap exists: AI-powered tools are nearly all cloud-dependent

### Impact
- No multi-device sync in version 1.0 (potential deal-breaker for some users)
- Collaboration features not possible initially
- Simpler architecture and security model
- Lower operational costs (no server hosting)
- Strong privacy positioning and marketing message
- May limit addressable market (validate with research)
- Technical advantage: can optimize for single-machine performance

## D004: Use Semi-Structured Interviews Over Surveys Only

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: research-lead
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need to validate hypotheses and understand user needs. Multiple research methods available with different tradeoffs.

### Options Considered
1. **Survey only**: Large-N quantitative survey, no interviews
2. **Interviews only**: Pure qualitative, no quantitative data
3. **Semi-structured interviews + screener survey**: Mixed methods (chosen)
4. **Focus groups**: Group discussions instead of individual interviews
5. **Diary study**: Users log experiences over time
6. **Usability testing with competitors**: Observe users with existing tools

### Decision Made
Conduct screener survey for quantification and recruitment (Nâ‰¥25) plus semi-structured interviews for depth (N=10). Interviews use "last time" narrative technique for concrete examples.

### Rationale
- Quantitative data alone misses "why" behind behaviors
- Qualitative alone lacks statistical validation of hypotheses
- Mixed methods provide both breadth and depth
- Semi-structured format balances consistency with exploration flexibility
- "Last time" narrative grounds discussion in reality versus hypothetical preferences
- 10 interviews sufficient for pattern identification at this stage (not academic research)
- Focus groups create groupthink; individual interviews more honest
- Diary studies too long for 2-week timeline
- Usability testing premature (no product yet)

### Impact
- 2-week research timeline achievable (screener + interviews in parallel)
- Hypothesis validation rigorous (quantitative thresholds + qualitative evidence)
- Budget increase for interview incentives ($250 for 10 participants)
- Requires interview guide development and interviewer training
- Richer findings than survey alone
- Quotable user stories for marketing and positioning

## D005: Offer Participant Incentives

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: research-lead, budget-owner
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
User research requires participant time and effort. Need to decide on compensation approach.

### Options Considered
1. **No incentive**: Rely on volunteers interested in topic
2. **Small incentive**: $10-15 gift card
3. **Standard incentive**: $25 gift card (chosen)
4. **Large incentive**: $50+ gift card or cash
5. **Product access**: Free or discounted product access instead of cash
6. **Donation**: Donation to charity in participant's name

### Decision Made
Offer $25 gift card (Amazon or equivalent) for completed 30-40 minute interviews. No incentive for screener survey completion (participation sufficient for beta access opt-in).

### Rationale
- Target users are professionals and students; time is valuable
- $25 is industry-standard for 30-minute consumer research
- Incentive increases recruitment speed and reduces no-show rate
- Shows respect for participant time and contribution
- More effective than product access (product doesn't exist yet)
- Amazon gift cards universally accepted and easy to distribute
- Total cost ($250 for 10 interviews) is justified by value of insights
- Lower incentive risks insufficient recruitment or quota imbalance
- Higher incentive unnecessary for this demographic and time commitment

### Impact
- Research budget increased by $250
- Faster recruitment expected (more volunteers)
- Lower no-show rate (participants have commitment)
- Professional research standard maintained
- Gift card distribution logistics required (email delivery within 24 hours)
- Tax implications minimal for participants (<$600 annual threshold)

## D006: Set Two-Week Research Timeline

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: research-lead, product-lead
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need to balance thoroughness of research with speed to market. Longer research reduces risk but delays launch; shorter research may miss critical insights.

### Options Considered
1. **One week**: Extremely rapid validation
2. **Two weeks**: Focused sprint (chosen)
3. **Four weeks**: More comprehensive research
4. **Six weeks+**: Academic-level rigor
5. **Rolling research**: No deadline, research until confident

### Decision Made
Commit to exactly two weeks (2025-11-01 to 2025-11-14) for complete Stage 1 validation: screener distribution, 10 interviews, analysis, and decision gate.

### Rationale
- Two weeks sufficient for 10 quality interviews with proper scheduling buffer
- Longer timeline increases risk of participant dropoff
- Maintains momentum and urgency
- Forces prioritization of most critical questions
- Competitive landscape moving fast; speed matters
- Stage 1 is validation, not exhaustive research (can iterate later)
- Tight deadline ensures focus and prevents scope creep
- One week too rushed for quality; four weeks diminishing returns

### Impact
- Hard deadline creates urgency and focus
- Buffer days built in (Nov 8-10) for schedule flexibility
- Analysis must be efficient (thematic coding, not full grounded theory)
- Decision gate occurs 2025-11-14 (go/hold/pivot determination)
- If research extends, delays entire project timeline
- Some deep-dive topics may be deferred to later research phases
- Forces excellent research instrument design (cannot iterate during study)

## D007: Use Falsifiable Hypotheses Framework

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: research-lead
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
User research can fall into confirmation bias trap. Need rigorous framework for validation that prevents seeing only what we want to see.

### Options Considered
1. **Open-ended exploration**: No predetermined hypotheses, pure discovery
2. **Falsifiable hypotheses**: Specific statements with disconfirming criteria (chosen)
3. **Feature validation**: Test predetermined feature list with users
4. **Problem/solution fit testing**: Present solution concept, gather feedback
5. **Jobs-to-be-Done only**: Focus solely on JTBD framework

### Decision Made
Create 10 falsifiable hypotheses with specific evidence thresholds and disconfirming evidence criteria. Use research to validate or invalidate each hypothesis. Require â‰¥6 of 10 validated for "go" decision.

### Rationale
- Falsifiable hypotheses force intellectual honesty
- Disconfirming evidence criteria prevent cherry-picking supportive data
- Quantitative thresholds eliminate subjective "it feels right" decisions
- Framework catches wrong assumptions early (before building)
- Open exploration risks confirming biases without realizing it
- Feature validation premature (don't know problems well enough yet)
- JTBD alone lacks quantitative validation rigor
- Scientific method applicable to product development
- Failed hypotheses are valuable learning (pivot signals)

### Impact
- Research plan structured around hypothesis testing
- Interview guide designed to gather evidence for each hypothesis
- Analysis includes explicit validation assessment per hypothesis
- Decision gate has objective criteria (not gut feel)
- May invalidate assumptions and force pivots (this is good)
- Stakeholders have clear evidence for decisions
- Reduces post-launch "we should have known" regrets

## D008: Develop Three Persona Archetypes

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Owner**: research-lead, product-lead
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Target market is "knowledge workers" but that is too broad for effective product design and marketing. Need to define specific user types.

### Options Considered
1. **Single persona**: Design for one ideal user
2. **Two personas**: Primary and secondary user types
3. **Three personas**: Core set covering main segments (chosen)
4. **Five+ personas**: Comprehensive coverage of all segments
5. **No personas**: Design for general "knowledge worker"
6. **Behavioral segments only**: Segment by behavior not demographics

### Decision Made
Create three draft personas (Rachel, Finn, Gia) representing corporate researchers, freelance creators, and graduate students. Recruit interview participants to match 5/3/2 distribution. Validate and refine personas through research.

### Rationale
- Three personas capture meaningful segment diversity without overwhelming complexity
- Each persona has distinct needs, budgets, and priorities
- 5/3/2 distribution reflects expected market opportunity (corporate researchers largest)
- Gives interview recruiting concrete targets
- Enables persona-specific value proposition testing
- Prevents design-by-committee "everyone needs everything"
- Rachel represents highest willingness-to-pay (corporate budget)
- Finn represents growing freelance economy
- Gia represents academic use case and student market
- More than three personas dilutes focus; fewer misses important segments

### Impact
- Recruitment screener designed to identify archetype fit
- Interview guide adaptable to persona context
- Value proposition document has three variants
- Future feature prioritization can reference personas
- Marketing messages tailored to each persona
- May discover personas are wrong or need adjustment (good outcome)
- Prevents building "for everyone" which satisfies no one

### Deprecation Criteria
A decision is deprecated and marked for reversal if:
- New evidence contradicts original rationale
- Impact is significantly different than expected
- External circumstances change materially
- Superior alternative becomes available

### Documentation Requirements
- All major decisions logged within 48 hours
- Include dissenting opinions if applicable
- Update status as decisions are implemented
- Link to supporting evidence or research

## Pending Decisions

Issues requiring decision before Stage 2:

1. **Business model**: Subscription vs one-time purchase (depends on research findings)
2. **Feature scope for MVP**: Minimum viable feature set (depends on priority validation)
3. **Technology stack**: Programming language and frameworks (depends on go/hold/pivot decision)
4. **Beta program structure**: Open vs closed beta, size, timeline (depends on go decision)
5. **Pricing tiers**: Single price vs multiple tiers (depends on willingness-to-pay research)

These will be decided after Stage 1 research completes (post 2025-11-14).

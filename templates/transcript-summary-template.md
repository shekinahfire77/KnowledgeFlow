## Must-Have Outcomes

**If they could wave a magic wand, what must the solution provide?**

*[These are dealbreakersâ€”solution is useless without these]*

1. **[Outcome 1 - e.g., "Instant retrieval of any note from past 2 years"]**
   - Why essential: [e.g., "Wastes 30+ min/day hunting for notes; blocks progress on client work"]
   - Quote: "[Supporting quote]"

2. **[Outcome 2 - e.g., "Auto-suggest connections between related ideas across projects"]**
   - Why essential: [e.g., "Manual linking takes 15 min/day; still misses 50% of connections"]
   - Quote: "[Quote]"

3. **[Outcome 3 - e.g., "Work fully offline during flights and client sites"]**
   - Why essential: [e.g., "Travels 2x/month; 4-6 hours offline where can't access Notion notes"]
   - Quote: "[Quote]"

---

## Willingness to Pay

### Stated WTP

**Amount:** $[#]/month

**Confidence:** [1-3, where 1 = hesitant, 3 = confident]

**WTP Band:** [Free only / <$5 / $5-10 / $10-20 / >$20]

---

### Justification Quote

> "[What they said about why they'd pay that amount, or why they wouldn't pay more]"

**Example:**
> "If it actually saves me 30 minutes a day, that's worth way more than $10. I bill $200/hour, so even 15 minutes is $50 of value."

---

### Price Anchors They Mentioned

*[What existing tools or prices did they compare to?]*

- [Anchor 1 - e.g., "Compares to Notion at $10/month for personal plan"]

---

### Value Drivers (What Would Increase WTP)

1. [Driver 1 - e.g., "Saves 1+ hour per day (quantified time savings)"]
2. [Driver 2 - e.g., "Replaces 2+ tools they currently pay for"]
3. [Driver 3 - e.g., "Enterprise-grade privacy/encryption (for client data)"]

---

### Price Resistance Factors (What Limits WTP)

1. [Factor 1 - e.g., "Comparing to free alternatives (Obsidian)"]
2. [Factor 2 - e.g., "Student budget constraints (Gia segment)"]
3. [Factor 3 - e.g., "Uncertainty whether features will work as promised"]

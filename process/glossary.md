# Glossary

## KnowledgeFlow
A Windows desktop application that merges semantic knowledge graphing with automation and productivity features. Privacy-first and offline-capable, KnowledgeFlow enables users to capture, link, and surface insights from their notes without relying on cloud services.

## Target Users
- **Researchers**: Individuals conducting systematic investigation, literature reviews, and data synthesis
- **Analysts**: Professionals analyzing information to derive insights, trends, and recommendations
- **Writers**: Content creators, journalists, authors who synthesize information into written output
- **Students**: Graduate and undergraduate students managing coursework, research projects, and literature
- **Freelancers**: Independent professionals managing multiple projects, clients, and knowledge domains

## Stage 1
Stage 1 is the planning and validation phase focused exclusively on non-technical activities. This stage produces research instruments, validation hypotheses, user personas, competitive analysis, and risk assessment. No code, prototypes, or technical specifications are produced in Stage 1. The goal is to validate the problem space and user needs before any technical investment.

## Key Concepts

### Semantic Knowledge Graph
A network representation of notes and concepts where relationships between ideas are explicitly defined and navigable. Unlike simple hyperlinks, semantic graphs enable inference, pattern discovery, and automated insight surfacing.

### Privacy-First
An architectural principle where user data remains on local devices by default. No cloud synchronization, telemetry, or external data transmission without explicit user consent.

### Offline-Capable
Full functionality without internet connectivity. All core features including search, linking, automation, and AI processing operate locally.

### Automation
System-driven actions that reduce manual work, such as auto-tagging, relationship suggestion, task extraction, and scheduled operations.

## Research Terms

### Falsifiable Hypothesis
A statement that can be proven false through observation or experiment. Must include specific thresholds and observable signals.

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
A framework for understanding user motivation by focusing on the functional, emotional, and social outcomes users seek rather than product features.

### Semi-Structured Interview
A research method using predefined topics with flexible follow-up questions to explore user experiences and needs.

### Screener Survey
A qualification instrument to identify participants matching target user criteria.

### Disconfirming Evidence
Observations or data that would disprove a hypothesis, essential for rigorous validation.

## Product Pillars

### Semantic Graph
Core capability enabling knowledge representation and relationship discovery.

### Automation
Features that reduce manual tagging, linking, and organization work.

### Privacy
Commitment to local-first architecture and user data sovereignty.

### Offline
Complete functionality without internet dependency.

### Local AI
Machine learning capabilities running entirely on user hardware without cloud API calls.

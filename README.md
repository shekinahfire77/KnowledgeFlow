# KnowledgeFlow - Stage 1: Planning & Validation

## Overview

KnowledgeFlow is a Windows desktop application that merges semantic knowledge graphing with automation and productivity features. Privacy-first, offline-capable note-taking designed for knowledge workers who need intelligent organization without cloud dependency.

**Current Stage**: Stage 1 - Planning and Validation (Non-technical)
**Timeline**: 2 weeks (2025-11-01 to 2025-11-14)
**Owner**: research-lead
**Status**: Draft documentation complete, ready for internal review

---

## Target Users

- **Researchers**: Corporate and academic researchers synthesizing information across multiple sources
- **Analysts**: Business intelligence, market research, and data analysts processing diverse inputs
- **Writers**: Content creators, journalists, and authors managing research and ideation
- **Students**: Graduate and undergraduate students conducting research and managing coursework
- **Freelancers**: Independent professionals juggling multiple client projects and knowledge domains

---

## Core Problem

Knowledge workers struggle with fragmented note-taking systems that scatter information across multiple tools without meaningful connections. Current solutions fail to surface insights automatically while compromising privacy through cloud-only architectures. Users lose 30+ minutes daily to context-switching, manual linking, and failed searches.

---

## Product Vision

Transform scattered notes into an intelligent, private knowledge system that:
- Automatically surfaces insights and connections through semantic understanding
- Keeps all data local with full offline capability
- Reduces organization overhead through intelligent automation
- Works seamlessly on Windows with native performance

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Internal review** of all Stage 1 documentation
2. **Stakeholder alignment** on hypotheses and research approach
3. **Finalize research instruments** based on feedback
4. **Prepare recruitment materials** for distribution

### Week of 2025-11-01 (Research Execution)
1. **Launch screener survey** across recruitment channels (Nov 1)
2. **Screen participants** and select interview candidates (Nov 3)
3. **Conduct 10 interviews** with qualified participants (Nov 4-11)
4. **Thematic analysis** of interview transcripts (Nov 12-13)
5. **Decision gate evaluation** - Go/Hold/Pivot (Nov 14)

### Post-Stage 1
- If **Go**: Proceed to Stage 2 (technical planning and prototyping)
- If **Hold**: Conduct additional targeted research to resolve ambiguities
- If **Pivot**: Reassess product concept based on invalidated hypotheses

---

## Decision Criteria

### Go Decision (Proceed to Stage 2)
- ≥ 6 of 10 hypotheses validated above evidence thresholds
- ≥ 60% of interview participants report pain severity ≥7/10
- ≥ 50% express willingness to pay $5-15/month or equivalent
- ≥ 40% use Windows as primary platform
- Clear feature priorities identified
- No critical disconfirming evidence on core assumptions

### Hold Decision (Additional Research Required)
- 4-5 of 10 hypotheses validated (partial validation)
- Pain scores moderate (5-7/10) but not severe
- Willingness to pay unclear or mixed signals
- Windows segment viable but needs deeper investigation

### Pivot Decision (Reconsider Product Concept)
- < 4 of 10 hypotheses validated (fundamental assumptions wrong)
- Pain scores insufficient to motivate switching (< 5/10)
- Willingness to pay too low (< $5/month majority)
- Windows segment too small (< 30%)
- Alternative problem space appears more compelling

Full decision criteria and thresholds documented in [Research Plan](docs/08-research-plan.md).

## Research Hypotheses (Summary)

1. **H1**: Users lose 30+ minutes daily to context-switching between tools
2. **H2**: Privacy concerns prevent 40%+ from using cloud note apps
3. **H3**: Users abandon manual linking due to effort burden
4. **H4**: Users fail to rediscover insights in their own notes weekly
5. **H5**: 30%+ require offline capability regularly
6. **H6**: 50%+ willing to pay $5-15/month with pain ≥7/10
7. **H7**: Automated features perceived as valuable not intrusive
8. **H8**: Windows users represent 40%+ of target market
9. **H9**: Import capability is table-stakes not enhancement
10. **H10**: Graph visualizations valuable for 50-500 nodes, overwhelming beyond 1000+

See [Problem Hypotheses](docs/02-problem-hypotheses.md) for detailed validation criteria.

- **Semantic Graph + Automation**: Automatic relationship discovery and insight surfacing
- **Offline-First + Windows-Native**: Full functionality without internet, optimized for platform

### Competitive Gaps We Fill
- **vs Obsidian**: Intelligent automation without manual configuration
- **vs Notion**: Privacy and offline capability without cloud compromise
- **vs OneNote**: Semantic intelligence and relationship discovery
- **vs Logseq**: User-friendly automation for non-technical users
- **vs Mem**: Local processing and privacy at affordable price

See [Competitive Landscape](docs/06-competitive-landscape.md) for full analysis.

## Three Core Personas

### Rachel - Research Analyst (50% of interviews)
Corporate researcher synthesizing insights across projects. Needs privacy, cross-project synthesis, reliable search. Willing to pay $10-15/month.

### Finn - Freelance Creator (30% of interviews)
Independent content professional managing multiple clients. Needs offline capability, simplicity, affordability. Willing to pay $5-10/month or one-time.

### Gia - Graduate Student (20% of interviews)
Academic researcher conducting literature-heavy research. Needs relationship visualization, citations, data safety. Budget-constrained (<$5/month).

See [User Personas](docs/04-user-personas-draft.md) for complete profiles.

## Risk Summary

**High Priority Risks**:
- Switching cost resistance (users won't leave free tools)
- Competitive feature parity (Obsidian adds AI before launch)
- AI quality perception (local models versus cloud expectations)
- Performance on typical hardware (slow inference)
- Onboarding complexity (steep learning curve)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Excellent import tools and migration support
- Speed to market with Windows optimization
- Set realistic expectations, optimize model selection
- Hardware requirements and performance tiers
- Investment in onboarding and tutorials

See [Risk Log](docs/07-risk-log.md) for complete risk register.

## Project Principles

### Stage 1 Principles
1. **Validation before building**: Test assumptions with users before writing code
2. **Falsifiable hypotheses**: Use scientific method to prevent confirmation bias
3. **User language**: Learn how users describe problems in their own words
4. **Evidence-based decisions**: Objective criteria for go/no-go, not gut feel
5. **Fast but thorough**: Two-week sprint, no shortcuts on quality

### Product Principles
1. **Privacy-first**: Local architecture is core, not compromise
2. **Offline-capable**: Full functionality without internet
3. **Intelligent automation**: Reduce manual work without losing control
4. **Windows-optimized**: Native platform integration, not cross-platform compromise
5. **User-focused**: Build for Rachel, Finn, and Gia, not everyone

**Current Stage**: Stage 1 - Planning and Validation (Non-technical)
**Timeline**: 2 weeks (2025-11-01 to 2025-11-14)
**Owner**: research-lead
**Status**: Draft documentation complete, ready for internal review

---

## Target Users

- **Researchers**: Corporate and academic researchers synthesizing information across multiple sources
- **Analysts**: Business intelligence, market research, and data analysts processing diverse inputs
- **Writers**: Content creators, journalists, and authors managing research and ideation
- **Students**: Graduate and undergraduate students conducting research and managing coursework

---

## Core Problem

Knowledge workers struggle with fragmented note-taking systems that scatter information across multiple tools without meaningful connections. Current solutions fail to surface insights automatically while compromising privacy through cloud-only architectures. Users lose 30+ minutes daily to context-switching, manual linking, and failed searches.

---

## Product Vision

Transform scattered notes into an intelligent, private knowledge system that:
- Automatically surfaces insights and connections through semantic understanding
- Keeps all data local with full offline capability
- Reduces organization overhead through intelligent automation
- Works seamlessly on Windows with native performance

## Project Principles

### Stage 1 Principles
1. **Validation before building**: Test assumptions with users before writing code
2. **Falsifiable hypotheses**: Use scientific method to prevent confirmation bias
3. **User language**: Learn how users describe problems in their own words
4. **Evidence-based decisions**: Objective criteria for go/no-go, not gut feel
5. **Fast but thorough**: Two-week sprint, no shortcuts on quality

### Product Principles
1. **Privacy-first**: Local architecture is core, not compromise
2. **Offline-capable**: Full functionality without internet
3. **Intelligent automation**: Reduce manual work without losing control
4. **Windows-optimized**: Native platform integration, not cross-platform compromise
5. **User-focused**: Build for Rachel, Finn, and Gia, not everyone

## Stage 2: Problem Validation & User Research

**Timeline**: 14 days (November 1-14, 2025)
**Owner**: research-lead
**Status**: Framework complete, ready for execution

### Overview

Stage 2 validates whether the problems identified in Stage 1 are real, severe, and represent viable market opportunities. Through screener surveys and semi-structured interviews, we test 10 hypotheses against measurable thresholds to make a data-driven GO/HOLD/PIVOT decision.

### Research Approach

**Method 1: Screener Survey**
- Target: N ≥ 40 qualified responses
- Platform: Google Forms or Typeform
- Purpose: Recruit qualified interview participants and validate quota targets

**Method 2: Semi-Structured Interviews**
- Target: N = 10 participants (40-minute interviews each)
- Segments: Rachel (3), Finn (3), Gia (2), Other (2)
- Method: Video interviews with detailed note-taking and optional recording
- Incentive: $25 Amazon gift card per completed interview

### Validation Thresholds

Stage 2 uses 6 core thresholds to determine GO/HOLD/PIVOT:

| Threshold | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Problem frequency | ≥70% weekly collisions | How often participants experience fragmentation |
| Pain severity (median) | ≥7/10 | Self-reported pain on 1-10 scale |
| Switching intent | ≥50% likely+ | Willingness to try new solution (4-5 on 5-point scale) |
| WTP median | $5-10/month | Stated willingness to pay |
| WTP premium | ≥30% at ≥$7/mo | Percentage willing to pay premium price |
| Differentiator resonance | ≥70% mention semantic/auto | What features resonate in concept card test |

**Decision Rule:**
- **GO**: ≥5 of 6 thresholds met → Proceed to Stage 3 (Solution Definition)
- **HOLD**: 3-4 thresholds met → Additional research or refinement needed
- **PIVOT**: ≤2 thresholds met → Reconsider segment, value prop, or problem focus

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint + Prettier formatting
- ✅ No console.log in production code
- ✅ All public APIs documented

**Testing:**
- ✅ Unit tests for semantic engine (>80% coverage)
- ✅ E2E tests for capture, search, task flows
- ✅ Manual smoke tests on Windows 10/11

**Performance:**
- ✅ Lighthouse audit ≥90
- ✅ Cold start timed <2s
- ✅ Search latency p95 <150ms

**Security:**
- ✅ No plaintext secrets in code
- ✅ Input validation on all boundaries
- ✅ SQLite parameterized queries
- ✅ Encryption APIs stubbed (ready for libsodium)

### Known Limitations & Future Work

**Stage 3 (MVP):**
- Semantic linking uses local TF-IDF (not ML models)
- Graph visualization is roadmap item (not in MVP)
- Cloud sync disabled (backend ready, UI pending)
- Encryption APIs stubbed (placeholder only)
- No mobile/Mac/Linux support

**Stage 4 (v1.0):**
- Wire frontend to backend via Tauri IPC
- Implement graph visualization (Cytoscape.js)
- Real encryption (libsodium integration)
- Full E2E test coverage
- Windows installer packaging

### Next Steps

**Immediate (After Stage 3 Complete):**
1. Begin Stage 4 frontend-backend integration
2. Hire additional backend and frontend developers
3. Set up continuous integration pipeline
4. Prepare beta testing infrastructure

**Timeline to v1.0:**
- Stage 4 (IPC Integration): 4 weeks (Dec 10 - Jan 6)
- Stage 5 (Polish & Hardening): 2 weeks (Jan 7 - 20)
- Beta Release: January 27, 2026
- v1.0 Production: February 10, 2026

# Coding Schema: [Category Name]

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** research-lead
**Category:** [Pain / Frequency / Task / Privacy / Automation / Graph / Trigger / WTP]

---

## Code: [CODE-ID]

**Example:** PAIN-001, FREQ-001, AUTO-001, etc.

---

### Label

**Short name:** [1-3 words describing the code - e.g., "Context Switching"]

---

### Category

**Category:** [Which axis? - Pain / Frequency / Task / Privacy / Automation / Graph / Switching Trigger / WTP]

---

### Definition

[Clear, specific definition of what this code captures. 2-3 sentences that leave no ambiguity.]

**Example:**
"Losing focus, time, or cognitive flow when switching between note-taking applications during a single work session. Includes both the time cost of switching and the mental disruption. Does not include switching between note apps and other software (e.g., browser, Slack)."

---

### When to Apply

[Explicit criteria for when to tag an excerpt with this code. Be specific about what qualifies.]

**Apply this code when:**
- [Criterion 1 - e.g., "Participant describes opening multiple note apps in sequence"]
- [Criterion 2 - e.g., "Participant mentions time lost or focus disrupted by switching"]
- [Criterion 3 - e.g., "Participant describes copying/moving content between apps"]

**Context required:**
[e.g., "Must be within same work session or task; switching apps across different days doesn't count"]

---

### When NOT to Apply

[Common edge cases or confusions. What looks similar but isn't this code?]

**Do NOT apply when:**
- [Edge case 1 - e.g., "Participant switches from note app to browser to research (that's workflow, not pain)"]
- [Edge case 2 - e.g., "Participant mentions general dissatisfaction with tools (need specific switching behavior)"]
- [Edge case 3 - e.g., "Switching happens but participant doesn't express pain or time cost"]

---

### Example Quote 1

> "[Verbatim example from an interview that clearly fits this code. Use real quote if available, or realistic example.]"
> — P### (Segment)

**Why this fits:**
[Brief explanation of how this quote exemplifies the code - 1-2 sentences]

---

### Example Quote 2

> "[Another example from a different participant or context]"
> — P### (Segment)

**Why this fits:**

---

### Example Quote 3 (Optional)

> "[Third example showing variation or edge case]"
> — P### (Segment)

**Why this fits:**

---

### Related Codes

[List codes that are similar, overlapping, or frequently co-occur. Explain differences.]

**Similar codes:**
- **[CODE-XXX]:** [Code label]
  - **Relationship:** [How are they related? - e.g., "PAIN-001 (Context Switching) often occurs with PAIN-008 (Cognitive Overhead) but distinguishable: PAIN-001 is about time/tool-switching; PAIN-008 is mental burden"]
  - **How to differentiate:** [Clear rule - e.g., "If quote mentions switching apps, use PAIN-001. If quote mentions decision fatigue about which tool to use, use PAIN-008. Can apply both."]

- **[CODE-YYY]:** [Code label]
  - **Relationship:**
  - **How to differentiate:**

**Frequently co-occurs with:**
- [CODE-ZZZ]: [Why they often appear together - e.g., "PAIN-001 often paired with FREQ-001 (Daily) because context-switching happens multiple times per day for most participants"]

### Frequency Tracking (Updated After Coding)

[Fill this in after coding all interviews]

**Mentions:**
- Participants mentioning: [#]/10 ([##]%)
- Total excerpts tagged (primary code): [#]
- Total excerpts tagged (secondary code): [#]

**Distribution by segment:**
- Rachel: [#]/[N] participants ([##]%)
- Finn: [#]/[N] participants ([##]%)
- Gia: [#]/[N] participants ([##]%)
- Other: [#]/[N] participants ([##]%)

**Frequency:**
- Most common in: [Segment name]
- Least common in: [Segment name]
- Universal (all segments): [Yes / No]

### Coding Notes

[Any clarifications, patterns observed, or considerations for analysis]

**Patterns observed:**
- [Pattern 1 - e.g., "Participants who used Notion + Obsidian mentioned this pain most frequently"]
- [Pattern 2 - e.g., "Pain severity correlated with number of tools used (>3 tools = higher severity)"]

**Coding challenges:**
- [Challenge 1 - e.g., "Sometimes hard to distinguish from PAIN-008; when in doubt, apply both and note overlap"]
- [Challenge 2 - e.g., "Participants often use vague language ('switching around'); probe for specific tool names"]

**Analysis implications:**
- [Implication 1 - e.g., "This is a universal pain; prioritize for product messaging"]
- [Implication 2 - e.g., "Time quantification varies widely (5-45 min/day); use median in value prop"]
